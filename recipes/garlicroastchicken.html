<p>Nothing beats an easy to make and even easier to prepare roast chicken! Especially when roasted with garlic butter,
    rosemary, parsley, lemon, and a hint of white wine for an unbeatable flavour. This Garlic Herb Butter Roast Chicken
    definitely beats the pants off of any rotisserie chicken!
</p>

<p>When we roast chicken, we don't do it with just a sprinkling of salt. No no no…we do it FLAVOUR. There is so much of
    it in this chicken that beats any restaurant chicken.</p>

<p>
    Easy to find ingredients you have in your fridge or pantry.

<ul>
    <li>Garlic + Butter = Garlic Butter</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    A touch of lemon
    A hint of dry white wine (optional, but adds so much flavour to the meat while keeping it so juicy)
    <li>Rosemary</li>
    <li>Parsley</li>
</ul>

    How to roast whole chicken
    Not only does this recipe give you a roast chicken with flavour… it delivers crispy skin, juicy meat and a nice
    dinner to go with the ultimate creamy mashed potatoes.

    The following steps makes this baked whole chicken stand out from the rest!

<ul>
    <li>Preheat oven.</li>
    <li>Rinse and pat dry chicken with paper towel.</li>
    <li>Combine olive oil, melted butter, wine (if using) and lemon juice together, rubbing all over the chicken, under
        the skin and inside the cavity.</li>
    <li>Season chicken outside and inside with salt, pepper and parsley. Don’t be afraid to use generous amounts!</li>
    <li>Rub the minced garlic over the chicken and under the skin. I do this separately as the last step to maximise the
        garlic taste.</li>
    <li>Stuff the garlic head into the chicken cavity along with the rosemary sprigs and the squeezed lemon halve. You
        can also use sprigs of Thyme or any other herb.</li>
    <li>Roast chicken, basting half way through cooking time, until cooked through.</li>
    <li>Broil until golden and crispy!</li>
</ul>

I like to go in the carcass, over the chicken and under the skin with all of my ingredients to ensure maximum taste. You
want every inch covered in flavour.
</p>

<p>how long to roast?
    Over one hour, depending on the size of your bird. This 4 pound (2kg) bird took one hour and 20 minutes cooking
    time, then a resting time of 10 minutes to keep all of those juices in before slicing.

    Usually I’ll pass on chicken breasts because juicy crispy chicken legs are my favourite! BUT! In this roast chicken
    recipe? I eat it ALL. The breasts come out so moist. NO dry meat happening on this plate!

    Do you see that crispy skin happening down there? ↓ That’s the part we fight over at the table. PLEASE tell me we
    are normal and your family fights over crispy skin too?

    SOOOO soft and juicy inside!</p>
